  <blockquote style="border: none"><p>Somewhere in China a woman is pregnant.<br />
What she doesn't know is she's having a girl.<br />
<br />
Her baby holds an invisble red thread<br />
the kind that connects those destined to meet.<br />
<br />
Through a year and more her newborn girl <br />
will travel through abandonment and orphanage. <br />
<br />
What she doesn't know is where that red thread leads.<br />
<br />
It leads to me.<br />
<br />
And I am waiting. <br />
<br />
To hold my daughter.<br />
