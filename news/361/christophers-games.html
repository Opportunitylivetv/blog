Christopher had a productive summer before
high school started writing a total of eleven flash games,
ten of them are on <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/search/author/xdragonx10">newgrounds</a> 
and his most recent, a team effort with another person, 
is <a href="http://www.itch.com/games/mech-slayer/">Mech Slayer</a>.
