title: SourceForge and  Subversion

---

  
  <p>After a long time of what I would describe as a 
  <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=passive-aggressive">passive-aggressive</a> stance,
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?group_id=1&amp;docid=19242#january-2006">
  SourceForge is finally going to start offering support for subversion</a>.
