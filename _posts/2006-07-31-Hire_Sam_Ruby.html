title: Hire Sam Ruby

---

  
  
<p>Sam Ruby has worked at IBM for 25 years and survived
  everything that goes along with that. 
  I work for IBM for <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Hire_Me">
     one day</a> and 
  <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2006/07/26/Quarter-Century-Club">
     he decides to move on</a>. 
     I'm just saying...
