  <p>Huge thanks to <a href="http://www.la-grange.net/">Karl Dubost</a>, who has <a href="http://www.la-grange.net/2005/05/rest/">translated</a> all my <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/at/34">Restful Web articles on XML.com</a> into French. I don't have words in either language to express how very cool that is.</p>
