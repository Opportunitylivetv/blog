        <p>At BarCampRDU Bill Higgins and John Ryding gave a presentation
        on server-side Javascript experiments they had done with the 
        Jazz platform. Two observations that struck me during the 
        presentation:</p>
        <ol> 
            <li>
                V8 was 10 times faster for them than Rhino, and that includes
                the dreaded JNI latency.
            </li> 
            <li>
                The idea that server-side JS may
                be a way to build AJAX applications and address the <a href=http://bitworking.org/news/427/js-rest-and-empty-windows>
                    "empty window"</a> problem.  </li>
        </ol>
