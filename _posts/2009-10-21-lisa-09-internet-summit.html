        <p> My upcoming travel plans include
        a trip to Baltimore, MD where
        I will be giving talk at <a href=http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa09/tech/>
            LISA '09 with Daniel Berlin
            on Google Wave</a>. The next day I will be attending
        <a href=https://www.internetsummit.com/>Internet Summit 09</a> in Raleigh's new convention
        center.
