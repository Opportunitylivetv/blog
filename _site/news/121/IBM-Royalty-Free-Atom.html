<blockquote><p>IBM just filed a blanket IPR disclosure relating to the activity of the Atompub WG. </p></blockquote>
<p>The terms are Royalty-Free, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory License to All Implementers. Licensing declaration is limited solely to standards-track IETF documents. The other part I'd like to highlight is that this applies to both the syndication format and the protocol.</p>
