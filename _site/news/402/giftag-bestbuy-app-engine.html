<a href="http://www.giftag.com/">Giftag</a> is a cool application put together by <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/">BestBuy</a>
using Google App Engine. On the Giftag blog the
developers posted <a href="http://blog.giftag.com/2009/01/26/giftaggoogle-app-engine-case-study/">a great video interview</a> on their
impressions of App Engine and what it was like to 
develop on it.
