title: CommentAPI namespace change

---

  
  <p>Just a heads-up that there has been a 
slight change to the <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/story/9">CommentAPI</a>.
This change is in the RSS auto-discovery, the namespace for the <code>wfw:comment</code>
element has changed from <code>http://wellformedweb.org</code> to <code>http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI</code>.
