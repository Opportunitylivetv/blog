    <p>
    The schedule isn't up yet, but I just found out today
    that my submission got accepted for this year's <a href=http://www.trianglegameconference.com/>Triangle
    Game Conference</a>. The really great news is that Christopher's 
    submission also got accepted. This will be the first time
    I've presented at the same conference as my son!
