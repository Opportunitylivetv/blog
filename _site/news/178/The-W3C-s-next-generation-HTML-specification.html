<blockquote><p>
We are resolved, then, that the W3C's next-generation HTML 
specification be named "HTML 5" and to start review of the text
of the HTML 5 and WF2 specifications, and we welcome Ian Hickson
and Dave Hyatt as editors (while remaining open to the
possibility of other editors in the future).
