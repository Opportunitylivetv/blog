        <blockquote><p>
            We are happy to announce that the developer instance of Google Wave is
            now available for experimental interoperability testing with other wave
            providers. This means that if you are interested in building a service
            that uses the Google Wave Federation Protocol, you can begin
            prototyping with a tool like FedOne against WaveSandbox.com.
