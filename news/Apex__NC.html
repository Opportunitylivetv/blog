<p> 
 Inspired by <a href="http://blog.unto.net/miscellaneous/aggregated-blog-and-news-feeds/">DeWitt</a> but having to 
 incorporate <a href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/">my work in other areas</a>, I'm happy to 
 introduce <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/apex/">Apex, NC</a>, aggregated news 
 about my town.
