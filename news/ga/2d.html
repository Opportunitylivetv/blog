  <p>Geometric Algebra is fascinating, and I believe solves a large number of
    problems that arise from a more traditional approach to vectors, but
    I&#39;ve been very disappointed with the quality of books and
    explainations I&#39;ve found, most of them zooming off into abstract
    realms too quickly, or spending an inordinate amount of time building up a
    generalized theory before finally getting to something useful.

  <p>This page, which I'll update as I go, will just explain GA
    for two dimensions, i.e.:

  <dl>
    <dd>
      <latex-pic> {\rm I\!R}^2 </latex-pic>
    </dd>
  </dl>
