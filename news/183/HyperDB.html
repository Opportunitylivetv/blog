<blockquote><pre>We're releasing the DB class we use for WordPress.com to the world. 
Amoung other things, it supports:

* Replication
* Failover
* Redundant (public/private) networks
* Local and remote datacenters
* Partitioning
* Different tables on different DBs
* Advanced stats for profiling
* More...?</pre></blockquote>
