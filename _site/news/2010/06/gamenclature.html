    <p>Videogame nomenclature seems to be slipping into my
    kids everyday speach. Two examples:</p>
    <p>Reilly was watching a preview for Men in Black and was
    impressed with the guns:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Woah, how did they get all those cool items?</p></blockquote>
    <p>Later he was playing cards at the kitchen table with his sister:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Pause the game, I'll be right back.</p></blockquote>
