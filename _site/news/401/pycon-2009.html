I will be at <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2009/about/">PyCon</a> 
this year (my first, w00t!) and
will be doing two sessions. The first is a tutorial, 
"Introduction to Google App Engine", and the second is 
my talk "The (lack of) design patterns in Python". If you've got
specific things you'd like to see covered in the
tutorial let me know in the comments or via email.
And hopefully I'll see you there.

    Excellent! Hey, grab me in the hall (or organize a BoF) and let's chat about a RESTful JSON spec.
