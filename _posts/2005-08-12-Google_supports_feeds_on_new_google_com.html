title: Google supports feeds on new.google.com

---

  
  <p>Google now supports syndication feeds for <a href="http://news.google.com">news.google.com</a>. [via <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001782.php">John Battelle</a>]</p>
<p>On the downside, the Atom feeds are version 0.3 and not 1.0. Let's hope that's
   just a minor oversight.</p>
