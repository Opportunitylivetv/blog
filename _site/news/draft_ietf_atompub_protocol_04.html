  <p>The latest draft of the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">Atom Publishing Protocol is now available</a>.
Normally we automatically produce diffs from the last version, but in this case the changes were
so large that the tool we use lost its mind and produced nothing of value. Sorry about that.
