title: The Not Blog

---

  
  <p>Mark Pilgrim is currently "not blogging" 
   in How-To form:  <a href="http://howto.diveintomark.org/">http://howto.diveintomark.org/</a>.
</p>
<p>Blogging is so last year, now it's about finding new ways to <em>not blog</em>.
Me? I'm gonna start <em>not blogging</em> in IETF Internet-Draft form.
