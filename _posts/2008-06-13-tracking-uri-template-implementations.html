title: Tracking URI Template Implementaions

---

  
  <p>
  I've been seeing URI Template implementations
  but not working at keeping a formal list of them, 
  then it dawned on me that I don't really need to 
  do that work myself. I've created
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/uri-templates/wiki/Implementations">a wiki page</a> to track
  such implementations, please feel free to add 
  to the list.
