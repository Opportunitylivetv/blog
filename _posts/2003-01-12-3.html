title: A Little Beyond Experimental

---

  
  <p>An amusing observation. I was reading the TrackBack specification and came across something
that I hadn't really thought about before. Here is the mime-type 
of the stuff sent to the server when you do POST from a web form:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></pre>
<p>Do you see that?</p>
<pre class="example"><code>application/<strong>x</strong>-www-form-urlencoded</code></pre>
<p>Yes, <strong>x</strong> for e<strong>x</strong>perimental. I think by now
that format is little beyond <em>experimental</em>. Hey, I thought it was amusing.
