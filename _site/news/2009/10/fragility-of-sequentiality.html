        <blockquote><p>No, no, they're not. What's the difference between a bug
            and a variation or an imperfection? If you think about it, if you
            make a small change to a program, it can result in an enormous
            change in what the program does. If nature worked that way, the
            universe would crash all the time. </p></blockquote>
