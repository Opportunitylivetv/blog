    <p>Six bugs have already been filed 
    against <a href=http://code.google.com/p/rst2rfc/>rst2rfc</a>, so 
    I'm going to take that as a good sign. The source has been moved
    into the repostory and I've created <a href=http://groups.google.com/group/rst2rfc>a mailing list for
      discussions</a>. If you have patches, please put them up
    on <a href=http://codereview.appspot.com>codereview.appspot.com</a>
    and make sure to inlucude me (joe@bitworking.org) as a reviewer.
    </p>
