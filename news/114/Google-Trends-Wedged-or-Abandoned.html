  <p>It looks like <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Labs-Trends/browse_frm/thread/6b7f851369b1ebd4">Google Trends hasn't been updated since
sometime in mid-November</a>. Did someone forget to press "Go" or has the project been abandoned? I hope it's not the latter as I found the site <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Framework_2_0">useful</a>.
